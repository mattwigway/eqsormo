    '''
    The variety of sorting model described in Tra CI (2013) Measuring the General Equilibrium Benefits of Air Quality Regulation in Small Urban Areas. Land Economics 89(2): 291â€“307.

    The key difference between this and the Bayer et al. model is that price is included in the first stage rather than the second stage. This obviates the need to instrument
    for price, because there are housing type fixed effects in the first stage. But we can't include price directly, due to identification
    challenges since the prices could also be captured by the ASCs. So instead we include a budget constraint of the form f(income, price) - Tra uses
    ln(income - price) but the exact functional form is not important, as long as income (or another household attribute) is somehow interacted with price
    so that there is variation in price between households

        :param price: Observed price of each housing choice. This price should be over the same time period as income (for example, annualized prices with annual incomes)
